vim is great; however, it has so many features - I often forget some.

This is a calendar file meant to be read by calendar(1) to send daily-reminders 
about features of vim. The intent here is to provide a gentle reminder of 
features so that they become more engrained in my usage.

Ideally, these short snippits lend the user to inquire of :help to learn deeper.

I have this placed in /home/dayid/.calendar/calendar.vim
My /home/dayid/.calendar file has at the top:
#include </home/dayid/.calendar/calendar.vim>

My systems run 'calendar -A 1 -a' to mail out daily reminders to users.
